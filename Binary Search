Question: Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

There are some points worth noting.
1. The termination condition is left <= right.
2. We calculate mid in each loop.
3. Not mid < target, it should be nums[mid] < target. Be more careful.
