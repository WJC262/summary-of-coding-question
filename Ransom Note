question:
Given two strings ransomNote and magazine, return true if ransomNote can be constructed by using the letters from magazine and false otherwise.

Each letter in magazine can only be used once in ransomNote.

You don't need to create a map for this question, array is all you need.
The difference between valid anagram is that, in this case, we need make sure that the same letters in magazine must more than letters in randoms. However the valid anagram ask the exact same number in
both string.
