Question: Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

The key point of this question is knowing how to use three pointer.
The first pointer is pre, pointing to the element before cur pointer.
The second pointer is cur, which always change it's direction to pre pointer.
The third pointer is tmp, to save the element after cur.

The basic idea is:
as long as cur is not null:
  tmp = cur->next
  cur->next = pre
  pre = cur
  cur = tmp

Finally we return pre.
