Question:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

1. Why we use unordered_map is because we not only need to compare the two values of elements but also need to return the index of the element. 
2. When seeing a question that ask you to search a certain value, use hash!
3. How do we insert a element into the hash table:
   map.insert(pair<int, int>(i, j));
4. I need to know the auto iter, which saves the element's value we need.
