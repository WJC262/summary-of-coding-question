Question: Given four integer arrays nums1, nums2, nums3, and nums4 all of length n, return the number of tuples (i, j, k, l) such that:

0 <= i, j, k, l < n
nums1[i] + nums2[j] + nums3[k] + nums4[l] == 0

The time complexity would be O(n4) if we used brute force method. However, by using unordered_map, the time complexity will be O(n2). 
The fundamental idea of unordered_map is to search. map is a kind of hash table. The difference between set and map is that map can store not only the indexs of the elements but the indexs of them.
