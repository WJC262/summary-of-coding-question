Question:
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

We use two pointers method, one from end to front, another one from front to end. we compare the two squared values of different pointer.
Important! index and value are two different thing, be careful when you use them next time!
