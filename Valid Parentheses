Q: Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

Using a stack to store every parentheses from string, then for every right parentheses, we pop the element in stack(after we check the stack is not empty). At last, the stack should be empty, and if not,
return false.
