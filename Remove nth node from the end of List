Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

The key point of this question is to locate the element index before the element we want to remove.
Using two pointer method, we move the first element n steps first, and then we move two pointer together.

Why we usually create a dummy head node? Because this can help us find out the first element after we make changes to the list.
