question:

Given two (singly) linked lists, determine if the two lists intersect. Return the interÂ­ secting node. Note that the intersection is defined based on reference, not value. That is, if the kth node of the first linked list is the exact same node (by reference) as the jth node of the second linked list, then they are intersecting.

The basic idea to solve this question is to have two pointer for each linked list at the location where they have the same index from the end of the list. 
We need to calculate the length difference between two lists. This is important, how to caculate the length of a list?
cur = head;
while(cur){//Because cur will be every element in the list, so it's so obvious to check if cur equals null.
  cur = cur->next;
  length++;
}
