Question:
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

1. The first part of the question is asking you to write a function that able to calculate the sum of different digits of a number.
2. By using unordered_set, we can check if an number already appeared, which means it would never reach 1.
3. Otherwise it will loop forever. It's part of the solution.
