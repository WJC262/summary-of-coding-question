Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty).

Implement the MyQueue class:

void push(int x) Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
int pop() Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
int peek() Returns the element at the front of the queue.
boolean empty() Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.

The key function for this question is pop(). First we have two stacks. How to return the element that goes into the first stack at first? To make the right sequence, we transfer the elements in first stack
to the second stack. We need to check is the second stack empty. If it is empty, then transferring all the elements to the another stack. If it's not empty, the pop the elemnt from the second stack directly.
